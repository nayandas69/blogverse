# Getting Started with MDX

MDX is a powerful format that lets you write JSX directly in your Markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components alongside your content!

## Why MDX?

Traditional Markdown is great for simple content, but sometimes you need more:

1. **Interactive Components**: Embed live code examples, charts, or interactive demos
2. **Consistent Styling**: Use your design system components
3. **Dynamic Content**: Pass props and use JavaScript expressions
4. **Type Safety**: Get full TypeScript support

## Basic Syntax

MDX supports all standard Markdown features:

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered lists:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
const blog = {
  name: "Nayan Das Blog",
  stack: ["Next.js", "MDX", "Tailwind CSS"],
  author: "nayandas69"
};

export default blog;
```

### Blockquotes

> MDX is the future of content for React-based websites.
> It combines the best of both worlds.

## Adding Custom Components

One of the best features of MDX is the ability to use custom components. For example, you can create callouts, embeds, and more!

<Callout type="info">
This is an info callout. You can use these to highlight important information in your posts.
</Callout>

## Embedding Videos

You can also embed YouTube videos directly:

<YouTube id="U6PZO1n9EPg" />

## Tables

MDX supports GitHub Flavored Markdown tables:

| Feature | Markdown | MDX |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Basic formatting | Yes | Yes |
| Code blocks | Yes | Yes |
| React components | No | Yes |
| Interactive content | No | Yes |

MDX is incredibly powerful for technical writing. It gives you all the simplicity of Markdown while unlocking the full power of React.
