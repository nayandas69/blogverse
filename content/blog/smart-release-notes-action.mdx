If you maintain an open-source project, you know how painful writing release notes can be.

- Manually scanning merged PRs  
- Grouping changes by type  
- Formatting Markdown  
- Making sure nothing is missed  

It’s repetitive. It’s error-prone. And honestly — it slows you down.

So I built **[Smart Release Notes Action](https://github.com/nayandas69/smart-release-notes-action)** — a GitHub Action that automatically generates clean, categorized release notes from your merged PRs and commits.

---

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Most teams either:

- Forget to write proper release notes
- Copy/paste PR titles manually
- Use auto-generated notes that lack structure
- Or maintain custom scripts that break over time

<Note>
Smart Release Notes Action automatically detects tag pushes, collects merged PRs and commits between tags, categorizes them, and outputs ready-to-publish Markdown.
</Note>

---

## Features

- 🔖 Automatic tag detection (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.)
- 🔀 Collect merged PRs between two tags
- 🏷️ Label-based categorization
- 🧩 Commit fallback when PRs aren’t available
- ⚙️ Custom JSON configuration for categories
- 📝 Clean Markdown output for GitHub Releases

<Success>
No more manual release writing. Just push a tag and your release notes are generated automatically.
</Success>

---

## Quick Setup

Create `.github/workflows/release-notes.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release Notes

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Generate Release Notes
        id: notes
        uses: nayandas69/smart-release-notes-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          body: ${{ steps.notes.outputs.changelog }}
````

Now just push a tag:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

Done 🎉

## Release Modes

You can choose how data is collected:

### PR Mode

Only uses merged pull requests.

### COMMIT Mode

Uses commit messages (great with Conventional Commits).

### HYBRID Mode (Default)

Combines PRs and direct commits.

<Tip>
If your team strictly uses PRs with labels, `mode: PR` gives the cleanest output.
</Tip>

---

## Custom Categories

You can fully customize how changes are grouped.

Create:

```
.github/release-config.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    { "title": "🚀 Features", "labels": ["feature", "enhancement"] },
    { "title": "🐛 Bug Fixes", "labels": ["bug", "fix"] },
    { "title": "📚 Documentation", "labels": ["docs"] }
  ],
  "uncategorizedTitle": "Other Changes"
}
```

<Important>
PRs are matched to the first category whose labels intersect with the PR's labels.
</Important>

---

## Example Output

```markdown
## 🚀 Features
- Add dark mode support (#123)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fix authentication race condition (#124)

## 📚 Documentation
- Update installation guide (#125)
```

Clean. Structured. Ready for production.

## Best Practices

* Use consistent PR labels (`feature`, `bug`, `docs`)
* Follow semantic versioning (`v1.0.0`)
* Use Conventional Commits for better commit parsing
* Always fetch full git history (`fetch-depth: 0`)

<Caution>
If you don’t fetch full history, tag detection may fail.
</Caution>

---

## Why I Built This

As an open-source maintainer, I wanted:

* Predictable release notes
* Custom categories
* Label-based structure
* Zero manual work

Most existing solutions were either too rigid or too generic.

So I built something flexible, developer-friendly, and configurable.

---

## Real World Use Case

Every time I push a version tag:

```
v1.3.0
```

The workflow:

1. Detects the previous tag
2. Collects merged PRs
3. Categorizes them
4. Generates Markdown
5. Publishes a GitHub Release

<Question>
What if there are no PRs?
</Question>

It automatically falls back to commit-based generation.

---

## Lastly — Configuration Validation
Release notes should:

* Be automatic
* Be structured
* Be readable
* Not waste your time

Smart Release Notes Action makes that possible.

<Success>
If you’re building in public or maintaining an open-source project, this will save you hours over time.
</Success>
