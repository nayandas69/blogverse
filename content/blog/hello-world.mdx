# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm **Nayan Das**, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, tutorials, and experiences in the world of development.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a variety of topics including:

- **Web Development**: Tips, tricks, and tutorials on building modern web applications
- **Programming**: Deep dives into various programming concepts and languages
- **Tech Reviews**: My thoughts on tools, frameworks, and technologies I use
- **Personal Projects**: Behind-the-scenes looks at what I'm building

## A Little Code Demo

Here's a quick example of some code you might see in my posts:

```typescript
// A simple greeting function
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```
