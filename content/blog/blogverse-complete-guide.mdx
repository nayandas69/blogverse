## How BlogVerse Works

### Content Management with MDX

BlogVerse utilises MDX (Markdown + JSX) for content authoring. This powerful combination allows you to write content in familiar Markdown syntax whilst embedding React components when interactivity is required.

All blog posts reside in the `/content/blog` directory as `.mdx` files. The system automatically discovers, parses, and renders these files without any additional configuration.

### The Blog Engine

The core functionality resides in `/lib/blog.ts`. This module handles:

1. **File Discovery** - Scanning the content directory for MDX files
2. **Frontmatter Parsing** - Extracting metadata using the `gray-matter` package
3. **Sorting** - Ordering posts by date (newest first)
4. **Filtering** - Retrieving individual posts by slug

```typescript
// Simplified example of how posts are fetched
export function getAllPosts(): PostMeta[] {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(POSTS_DIRECTORY)
  
  return files
    .filter(file => file.endsWith('.mdx'))
    .map(file => {
      const content = fs.readFileSync(
        path.join(POSTS_DIRECTORY, file), 
        'utf-8'
      )
      const { data } = matter(content)
      return {
        slug: file.replace('.mdx', ''),
        frontmatter: data as PostFrontmatter
      }
    })
    .sort((a, b) => 
      new Date(b.frontmatter.date).getTime() - 
      new Date(a.frontmatter.date).getTime()
    )
}
```

### Server-Side Rendering

BlogVerse leverages Next.js 16's App Router with React Server Components. This architecture ensures:

- **Optimal Performance** - Pages render on the server, minimising client-side JavaScript
- **Excellent SEO** - Search engines receive fully-rendered HTML
- **Fast Initial Load** - Content appears immediately without hydration delays

## Creating Blog Posts

### Post Format

Each blog post requires a frontmatter section at the beginning of the file. This metadata controls how the post appears throughout the site.

#### Basic Post Template

Create a new file in `/content/blog/` with the `.mdx` extension:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2026-01-30"
description: "A brief description for SEO and social sharing."
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
cover: "/images/your-cover-image.png"
---

Your content begins here. Write in standard Markdown syntax.

## Section Heading

Continue writing your content...
```

#### Complete Frontmatter Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | The post title displayed on the page and in listings |
| `date` | Yes | Publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| `description` | Yes | Brief summary for SEO meta tags and post previews |
| `tags` | No | Array of relevant tags for categorisation |
| `cover` | No | Path to cover image (relative to `/public`) |
| `updated` | No | Last updated date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |

#### Example with All Fields

```mdx
---
title: "Mastering React Server Components"
date: "2026-01-15"
updated: "2026-01-28"

## Heading 2 (main sections)
### Heading 3 (subsections)
#### Heading 4 (minor sections)
```

```markdown
- Unordered item one
- Unordered item two
  - Nested item

1. Ordered item one
2. Ordered item two
```

````markdown
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```
````

```

#### Blockquotes

> or to highlight important information.
```

## Customisation

### Changing Site Information

Update the site metadata in `/app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Your Name',
  description: 'Your site description',
  // Additional metadata...
}
```

### Modifying the Theme

The colour scheme is defined in `/app/globals.css` using CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --background: oklch(0.98 0.01 350);
  --foreground: oklch(0.20 0.02 350);
  --primary: oklch(0.65 0.25 350);
  --accent: oklch(0.55 0.20 350);
  /* Additional variables... */
}
```

Adjust these values to create your unique colour palette.

### Updating Navigation

Edit the navigation links in `/components/header.tsx`:

```typescript
const navItems = [
  { label: 'Home', path: '/' },
  { label: 'Blog', path: '/blog' },
  { label: 'About', path: '/about' },
  // Add or modify links as needed
]
```

### Configuring Social Links

Update the footer social links in `/components/footer.tsx` with your profiles.

## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

The simplest deployment method is through Vercel:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
