# Building My Personal Blog with Next.js and MDX

I recently built this blog from scratch, and I wanted to share the entire process with you. This post covers the architecture, design decisions, and technical implementation details.

## Why I Chose This Stack

After evaluating several options, I settled on a stack that prioritises performance, developer experience, and content flexibility.

### Next.js 16

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for content-heavy websites. The App Router architecture enables clean separation between server and client components, whilst Server Components allow efficient data fetching without client-side JavaScript overhead.

### MDX for Content

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This means I can write posts in a familiar format whilst embedding interactive elements when needed.

```typescript
// How MDX content is processed
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'
import { mdxComponents } from '@/components/mdx-components'

export function MDXContent({ source }: { source: string }) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote 
      source={source} 
      components={mdxComponents}
    />
  )
}
```

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind enables rapid styling with utility classes. Combined with CSS custom properties, it provides a maintainable theming system.

## The Pink Creative Theme

I designed a custom colour palette that reflects my personal brand. The theme uses CSS custom properties for easy customisation.

```css
:root {
  --Background: #FFF5F7;
  --Surface: #FFFFFF;
  --Text-main: #1A1A2E;
  --Text-mute: #6B7280;
  --Border: #F9D5E5;
  --Accent: #EC4899;
}
```

These variables cascade through the entire application, ensuring visual consistency across all components.

## Project Architecture

The file structure follows Next.js conventions with some custom additions for blog functionality.

```
/app
  /blog
    /[slug]
      page.tsx      # Individual post pages
    page.tsx        # Blog listing
  page.tsx          # Homepage
  layout.tsx        # Root layout
/components
  blog-card.tsx     # Post preview cards
  header.tsx        # Navigation
  mdx-components.tsx # Custom MDX renderers
/content
  /blog
    *.mdx           # Blog posts
/lib
  blog.ts           # Post fetching utilities
  blog-types.ts     # TypeScript definitions
```

## Content Management

Blog posts reside in the `/content/blog` directory as MDX files. Each post requires frontmatter metadata.

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2026-01-27"
description: "Brief description for SEO and previews"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
cover: "/images/cover.jpg"
---
```

The `lib/blog.ts` module handles reading and parsing these files using the `gray-matter` package.

```typescript
export function getAllPosts(): PostMeta[] {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(POSTS_DIRECTORY)
  
  return files
    .filter(file => file.endsWith('.mdx'))
    .map(file => {
      const content = fs.readFileSync(
        path.join(POSTS_DIRECTORY, file), 
        'utf-8'
      )
      const { data } = matter(content)
      return {
        slug: file.replace('.mdx', ''),
        frontmatter: data as PostFrontmatter
      }
    })
    .sort((a, b) => 
      new Date(b.frontmatter.date).getTime() - 
      new Date(a.frontmatter.date).getTime()
    )
}
```

## Custom Syntax Highlighting

Rather than relying on external libraries, I implemented a lightweight tokeniser for code blocks. This approach reduces bundle size whilst maintaining attractive syntax highlighting.

```typescript
function tokenize(code: string): Token[] {
  const tokens: Token[] = []
  let remaining = code
  
  while (remaining.length > 0) {
    // Match comments, strings, keywords, etc.
    // Return typed tokens for consistent styling
  }
  
  return tokens
}
```

The tokeniser identifies comments, strings, keywords, numbers, functions, and operators, applying appropriate colour classes to each.

## Scroll Reveal Animations

To enhance the user experience, I added scroll-triggered animations using the Intersection Observer API.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    (entries) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          entry.target.classList.add('revealed')
        }
      })
    },
    { threshold: 0.1 }
  )
  
  // Observe all elements with reveal classes
}, [])
```

Elements fade and slide into view as users scroll, creating a polished, modern feel.

## RSS Feed

The blog includes an RSS feed for readers who prefer feed aggregators. The `/app/rss.xml/route.ts` file generates valid XML dynamically.

```typescript
export async function GET() {
  const posts = getAllPosts()
  
  const xml = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <rss version="2.0">
      <channel>
        <title>Nayan Das Blog</title>
        ${posts.map(post => `
          <item>
            <title>${post.frontmatter.title}</title>
            <link>${SITE_URL}/blog/${post.slug}</link>
          </item>
        `).join('')}
      </channel>
    </rss>`
  
  return new Response(xml, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/xml' }
  })
}
```

## Typography and Fonts

The blog employs three carefully selected fonts:

- **Inter** for body text, ensuring excellent readability
- **Cal Sans** for headings, adding personality
- **JetBrains Mono** for code blocks, optimised for technical content

```typescript
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
const jetbrainsMono = JetBrains_Mono({ subsets: ['latin'] })
const calSans = localFont({
  src: '../public/fonts/CalSans-SemiBold.woff2'
})
```

## Performance Considerations

Several optimisations ensure fast page loads:

1. **Server Components** - Most pages render on the server, minimising client JavaScript
2. **Static Generation** - Blog posts are statically generated at build time
3. **Image Optimisation** - Next.js automatically optimises images
4. **Minimal Dependencies** - Only essential packages are included

## Lessons Learned

Building this blog taught me several valuable lessons:

- **Separation of concerns matters** - Keeping server and client code distinct simplifies debugging
- **Custom solutions can outperform libraries** - The syntax highlighter is lighter than alternatives
- **Design systems save time** - CSS custom properties enable rapid, consistent styling

## What Comes Next

I plan to add several features in future updates:

- Search functionality
- Dark mode toggle
- Reading time estimates
- Related posts suggestions

## Conclusion

This blog represents my approach to web development: clean code, thoughtful design, and attention to detail. The combination of Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS provides a solid foundation for content creation.
